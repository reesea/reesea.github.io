# **OWASP Top 10 Application Security Overview**
*Prepared for Applied Information Assurance Projects*  
*Date: October 2025*

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

This report provides an applied overview of the **OWASP Top 10 (2021 Edition)**‚Äîa globally recognized awareness document for web application security.  
It identifies the most critical risks impacting software assurance and maps them to the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** to demonstrate how developers and organizations can align vulnerability management with governance and risk-based controls.

> **Objective:** To bridge technical security testing with information assurance practices, emphasizing prevention, detection, and response maturity.

## **2. Overview of the OWASP Top 10 (2021)**

The OWASP Top 10 represents data-driven insights into the most prevalent and severe web vulnerabilities.  
It serves as a living benchmark for secure development and auditing activities.

| **ID** | **Risk Category** | **Description** |
|:------:|:------------------|:----------------|
| **A01: Broken Access Control** | Authorization enforcement failures enabling unauthorized actions or data access. |
| **A02: Cryptographic Failures** | Misuse or absence of encryption, leading to exposure of sensitive data. |
| **A03: Injection** | Unsanitized input passed to interpreters (e.g., SQL, OS commands). |
| **A04: Insecure Design** | Fundamental flaws in architecture or threat modeling. |
| **A05: Security Misconfiguration** | Default accounts, open S3 buckets, or verbose error messages. |
| **A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components** | Use of obsolete or unpatched software dependencies. |
| **A07: Identification & Authentication Failures** | Weak credentials or poor session management. |
| **A08: Software & Data Integrity Failures** | Unverified code updates or compromised CI/CD pipelines. |
| **A09: Security Logging & Monitoring Failures** | Insufficient detection and response visibility. |
| **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | Improperly validated external resource requests. |

## **3. Mapping OWASP Risks to NIST CSF Functions**

This alignment highlights how OWASP technical vulnerabilities correlate with the **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover** functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

| **NIST CSF Function** | **Example OWASP Categories** | **Focus Area** |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------|:----------------|
| **Identify (ID)** | A06 | Inventory and management of assets and components. |
| **Protect (PR)** | A02, A04, A07 | Secure system design, cryptography, and access control. |
| **Detect (DE)** | A09 | Log monitoring and anomaly detection. |
| **Respond (RS)** | A03, A08 | Incident response and mitigation of exploited components. |
| **Recover (RC)** | A01, A05 | Configuration restoration and process resilience. |

> **Insight:** Integrating OWASP principles into a CSF-based security program supports both compliance alignment and real-world operational defense.

## **4. Risk Reduction Strategies**

| **Risk Type** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|:---------------|:-----------------------|
| Injection (A03) | Validate all inputs using whitelisting and parameterized queries. |
| Security Misconfiguration (A05) | Implement configuration baselines and hardening checklists. |
| Outdated Components (A06) | Track dependencies and enforce patch management through CI/CD pipelines. |
| Authentication Failures (A07) | Adopt MFA and session timeout enforcement. |
| Logging Failures (A09) | Centralize logs and enable real-time alerting. |

## **5. Key Takeaways**

- The OWASP Top 10 should be used as a **baseline** for security testing and code review.  
- Each risk maps directly to **CSF categories**, allowing for enterprise-level risk reporting.  
- Continuous training and vulnerability assessment tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) strengthen control assurance.  
- Emphasis on **secure design and monitoring** closes the gap between technical defense and organizational assurance.
