# **Network and Vulnerability Assessment â€“ OpenVAS Web Server Scan**
*Prepared for Applied Information Assurance Projects*  
*Date: September 2025*

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

This report summarizes the results of a comprehensive **vulnerability assessment** performed on a web server using **Greenbone OpenVAS**.  
The objective was to evaluate exposed services, identify potential security weaknesses, and provide mitigation recommendations aligned with **NIST CSF** and **OWASP** best practices.

> **Objective:** To demonstrate how automated vulnerability scanning supports risk-based assurance, compliance alignment, and proactive defense for web-facing systems.

---

## **2. Scan Overview**

| **Parameter** | **Details** |
|:---------------|:------------|
| **Scan Target** | Internal Web Server (10.200.x.x) |
| **Scan Profile** | Full and Fast (Unauthenticated) |
| **Feed Version** | Greenbone Community Feed â€“ October 2025 |
| **Duration** | 1 hour 17 minutes |
| **Total Results** | 247 vulnerabilities detected |
| **Severity Range** | Low (2.0) â†’ Critical (9.8) |
| **CVSS Standard** | CVSS v3.1 |

The scan covered HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, and supporting web application components.

---

## **3. Key Findings**

| **Severity** | **Category** | **Example Vulnerability** | **CVSS Score** |
|:--------------|:-------------|:---------------------------|:---------------:|
| **Critical** | Outdated OpenSSL library | TLS 1.0 / 1.1 enabled; multiple CVEs (CVE-2023-3446) | 9.8 |
| **High** | Apache server misconfiguration | Directory listing and default test pages exposed | 8.6 |
| **High** | PHP version disclosure | PHP 7.4.x EOL â€“ remote code execution risk | 8.1 |
| **Medium** | Weak HTTP response headers | Missing CSP and HSTS headers | 6.5 |
| **Medium** | Self-signed certificate | Untrusted root CA detected | 6.1 |
| **Low** | ICMP timestamp replies | Host fingerprinting information leak | 3.4 |

> **Observation:** The server exposes several outdated components and protocol weaknesses.  
> No active exploitation was detected, but the configuration state increases risk to data integrity and service availability.

---

## **4. Risk Analysis**

Vulnerabilities were ranked using **CVSS v3.1** scoring and mapped to **NIST CSF functions** to support structured remediation.

| **Risk Level** | **Action Priority** | **NIST CSF Function** |
|:---------------:|:--------------------|:----------------------|
| **Critical (â‰¥9.0)** | Patch immediately; verify post-remediation scan | Protect (PR) / Respond (RS) |
| **High (7.0â€“8.9)** | Apply updates; disable insecure protocols | Protect (PR) |
| **Medium (4.0â€“6.9)** | Adjust configurations; improve headers and TLS policy | Detect (DE) / Protect (PR) |
| **Low (<4.0)** | Monitor and log for anomalous activity | Identify (ID) / Detect (DE) |

---

## **5. Remediation Recommendations**

1. **Patch Management:**  
   - Upgrade OpenSSL â‰¥ 3.x and disable deprecated TLS versions.  
   - Update Apache HTTP Server and PHP runtime to latest supported releases.
2. **Web Configuration Hardening:**  
   - Disable directory indexing and remove test pages.  
   - Enforce HTTPS only; apply strong cipher suites (AES-256-GCM).  
3. **Security Headers:**  
   - Implement HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options headers.  
4. **Certificate Management:**  
   - Replace self-signed certificates with CA-issued equivalents.  
5. **Monitoring & Re-assessment:**  
   - Integrate OpenVAS reports with SIEM or log analysis tools.  
   - Schedule monthly scans to validate remediation progress.

---

## **6. Assurance Alignment**

| **Framework** | **Relevant Controls / Domains** |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------|
| **NIST CSF 2.0** | Identify (ID.AM), Protect (PR.IP), Detect (DE.CM) |
| **ISO 27001:2022** | A.12 Operations Security, A.18 Compliance |
| **OWASP Top 10** | A05 Security Misconfiguration, A06 Vulnerable Components |
| **NIST SP 800-115** | Technical Testing and Vulnerability Management Lifecycle |

> Mapping findings to standardized controls enables measurable improvement of system assurance posture.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

The OpenVAS scan of the internal web server revealed multiple high-risk vulnerabilities related to outdated software and insecure defaults.  
Addressing these issues through timely patching, configuration hardening, and continuous scanning will significantly improve confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
This assessment demonstrates how automated vulnerability management directly supports **risk reduction** and **compliance validation** within an **information assurance framework**.
